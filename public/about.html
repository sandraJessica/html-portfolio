  My name is Sandra Jessica Wittek. Born in Prien am Chiemsee in Bavaria, I grew
  up surrounded by the scenic landscapes of Grabenstätt and Winkl, near the
  beautiful lake Chiemsee. Nowadays, I call Ismaning, close to Munich, my home.

  I began my career with a solid foundation in hospitality, completing my
  training as an assistant in hotel- and tourism management at the School of
  Young Tourism in Freilassing. Since 2014, I’ve been a flight attendant with
  Deutsche Lufthansa, embracing my love for travel and meeting people from
  around the world. In 2019, I decided to expand my horizons further by pursuing
  a Bachelor’s degree in Media Informatics through a distance learning program
  at IU International University.

  When I’m not flying or studying, I love playing the E-bass, attending
  concerts, capturing moments through photography, or planning my next diving
  adventure. Thanks for stopping by!
